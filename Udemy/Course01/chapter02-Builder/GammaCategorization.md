Software Design patterns are split into three different categories. These are called **GemmaCategorization**. Word *Gemma* came from one of the author of the book **Design Patterns**, known as one of GoF (Gang of four).

So, those categories are:

1. Creational Patterns
    Concerns about things related to creating, constructing the class, object etc.
    a. Deals with creation
    b. Explicit (constructor) vs. Implicit (DI[Dependency Injection], Reflection etc).
    c. Wholesale (single statement) vs. Pieces (step-by-step)
2. Structural Patterns
    Concerns about the structure of classes or objects.
    a. Concerned with structure
    b. Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface.
    c. Stess the importance of good API design
3. Behavioral Patterns
    They are all different, no central theme
